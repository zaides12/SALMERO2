			<br>
			I studied at <strong> Abellana National School </strong> when I was in my Junior High School years for 3 years and on my last year I transferred at <strong> University of San Carlos South Campus </strong>.For me, my highschool life was the best, I learned a lot of things and was able to do a lot of things, my talents and other abilities started to sprout. My highschool years was so fun and enjoyable. I had wonderful classmates and friends, and also met a lot of people. I started gaining confidence because my mind and body had grown which resulted me being <em> effortlessly attractive</em> ( ◞⁽˙³˙⁾~ ). I liked going to school so much and I participated a lot in class and had very good grades. Most of my personality today was developed through my experiences in junior high school. I also had embarassing moments in my junior highschool, as well as very bad decisions which my friends and I could reminisce and laugh to it. <br>
